  <p id="aboutus">ABOUT US</p>
  <p id="aboutparagraph">Two dudes from a small town in Kansas had a dream of something bigger in life. What started out as a pipe dream quickly became a reality as we dropped our lives and everything we owned to travel the worldâ€¦</p>
  <p id="ourgoal">OUR GOAL</p>
  <p id="ourparagraph">Our goal is to travel through all 50 states on a documented, continuous journey. While walking, we want to develop ourselves as humans - working on our music, skills, languages, and meditation. We plan to become the best version of ourselves while viewing the best sites in America. We want the world to be inspired, and to follow us along on our journey.</p>
  <p id="whatspowering">WHAT'S POWERING US</p>
  <p id="whatsparagraph">We want to show the world that anyone can follow their dreams and live life the way they want to. Our strongest belief and the core of our success is our mindset of "We'll figure it out." I'm fairly certain we've both said that line over 100 times since we've begun planning this journey, and I believe it will guide us through the toughest of times. We whole-heartedly believe we can complete this journey, and with the help of everyone around us, it'll make the task that much easier.</p>
