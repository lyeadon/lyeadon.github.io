  <p id="firsttext">WHAT ARE WE DOING?</p>
  <p id="paragraph">We are walking across all 50 states. We will bring one person along with us, following in a car for safety and health concerns. Our main source of income will be through donations, sponsors, and odd jobs we do along the way.</p>
  <p id="maintext">WHERE CAN I FOLLOW THE JOURNEY?</p>
  <p id="paragraph">We have many Social Medias linked in our “Contact Us” subpage that we would love for you to follow us through! Just click on the link provided in the subpage and click subscribe, follow, like, etc. Thank you for your support!</p>
  <p id="maintext">CAN I JOIN YOU IN PERSON?</p>
  <p id="paragraph">We love any kind of support. However, at the moment since we are at the beginning of our journey, we do not have any set times for when we will be arriving in certain places. Therefore, we ask that you do not expect to walk with us without prior contact through our email or social media.</p>
  <p id="maintext">HOW CAN I SPONSOR YOU?</p>
  <p id="paragraph">You can sponsor our trip by going to the “Contact Us” subpage and sending an email to our business account listed there. We encourage you to leave a phone number, company name, and short message stating that you would like to sponsor us. Thank you!</p>
  <p id="maintext">CAN I DONATE WITHOUT COMMITTING TO SPONSORING?</p>
  <p id="paragraph">Yes, you can! Go to our “Contact Us” subpage and click on any of our donation options! We have Patreon for only $3/mth for those who want some “Behind The Scenes" content, and GoFundMe for those who want a secure known website to donate through. We also have CashApp, Venmo, and PayPal available! Of course donating is never mandatory, following us on Social Media is enough!</p>
  <p id="maintext">WHAT DO I DO IF THE WEBSITE WON'T WORK?</p>
  <p id="paragraph">If the website has any errors whatsoever, please contact our I.T. support through support@toodudes.com Our website staff will be able to assist you through there. Please allow some time for them to respond however, as they are volunteers and not able to access the site at all times.</p>
  <p id="maintext">IS THIS SAFE?</p>
  <p id="paragraph">To answer bluntly, no. However, we do have a person following us in a car in case we run into any medical or safety concerns. Nothing is safe, but that is not going to stop us from inspiring others and doing something we’ve dreamed about.</p>
  <p id="maintext">HOW CAN YOU AFFORD THIS?</p>
  <p id="paragraph">We sold a lot of our assets in order to develop a savings to get us by at first. We also plan on doing odd jobs along the way. Donating and Sponsors are what we plan to rely on once we’ve developed enough of a following and reputation. You can check out how to do that in the “Contact Us” subpage!</p>
  <p id="maintext">DID WE NOT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION?</p>
  <p id="paragraph">There are many ways to ask us any and all questions. For website support please contact us through our support gmail. support@toodudes.com You can also contact us through any of the links in our “Contact Us” subpage. </p>
